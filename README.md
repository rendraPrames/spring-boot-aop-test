# spring-boot-aop-test
i'am trying to implement AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) using Spring Boot
AOP is a programming paradigm that enables the separation of application functionality into distinct components called "aspects." 
An aspect is a unit of logic that can be applied in multiple places within the application to achieve specific goals, 
such as logging, transactions, security, caching, etc. 
In AOP, you define separate aspects that can be applied declaratively to specific parts of the code without modifying the original code.
